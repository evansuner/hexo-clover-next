## Transcript
**Alec**: What’s that gizmo you’ve got there?

**Belle**: It’s the latest electronic reader actually. Got it a couple of months ago.

**Alec**: Oh yeah? I prefer real books myself.

**Belle**: It’s really good! Actually I was never that interested in having one, but I’m so glad I bought it. It’s been a change for the better because I’ve been reading a load more than before.

**Alec**: How many books have you got on there?

**Belle**: Oh loads … and the great thing is, whereas before, if I was going away somewhere, I never knew how many books to pack. I didn’t want to pack too many because it was too heavy. But with this you can choose all kinds of different things, it’s great.

**Alec**: And much lighter!

**Belle**: Yeah. Another thing I really like is how user-friendly it is. Turning the pages is just so intuitive.

**Alec**: Wow. That’s cutting edge technology!

Belle: One of the disadvantages though is it’s a bit addictive and you can buy things online with one click.

**Alec**: Oh right. So you’ve bought …

**Belle**: So I’ve bought more books than I would’ve done, definitely.

**Alec**: But how do you find reading off the screen? Doesn’t it hurt your eyes?

**Belle**: I thought I’d hate it, but I can read off the screen for hours, no problem. I was a bit of doubter to start with but it’s completely won me over.

**Alec**: Hmm … Maybe I should get one.
