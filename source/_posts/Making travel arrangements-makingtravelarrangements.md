## AudioScript

TA = travel agent; C = customer

TA: Hello. How can I help you?

C: I'd like to book a flight to New York.

TA: Could you tell me when you'd like to travel?

C: The 17th to 24th of June.

TA: Let me check. A return flight leaving on Friday the 17th and returning on the 24th is €1,800.

C: Hmm, I wonder if it'd be cheaper on another date. I'm fairly flexible.

TA: Let's try Thursday the 16th to the 23rd then.

C: Okay.

TA: Yes, flying out on the 16th and returning on the 23rd would be €1,100.

C: That's better. Is it a direct flight?

TA: No, there's a two-hour lay-over.

C: Do you know if that'll give me enough time to get the connecting flight?

TA: Yes, that should give you plenty of time.

C: And can you tell me what time the flight leaves?

TA: 2.15 in the afternoon and you'll arrive back on the 23rd at 6.10 in the evening.

C: That's perfect. I'd like to book that one, please.

TA: Right, I'll do that now.

C: I'd also like to know if you can book me a hotel.

TA: Do you have anything specific in mind?

C: Not really. Something not too expensive, but fairly central.

TA: Let's see, there's The George not far from Central Park. That's €800 for the week. Or there's this other three-star hotel which is a bit further out for €700.

C: I'd prefer the George I think. Is breakfast included?

TA: No, I'm afraid not, but you can pay extra for breakfast or find something nearby.
