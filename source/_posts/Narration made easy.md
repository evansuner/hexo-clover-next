## Transcript
Some years back, when I was around 18 or 19, I went on holiday to the U.S. I was there for about two weeks and I had an absolutely great time apart from this one thing that happened to me while I was in California. It was around eight o’clock at night and I needed to use the Internet. Fortunately, I found a bookshop near my hotel that had free Wi-Fi. I had been using the Internet for about 5 minutes when suddenly everything went dark. At first, I thought that there had been a power cut. I waited for a few minutes and then decided to find out what was happening. The store was completely dark though and by the time I got to the entrance, I found that the main door was locked and all the staff had gone home. They had closed the shop and I was locked inside. Obviously, I was absolutely terrified. It was a large old building and I couldn’t see a thing. Unfortunately, I had left my mobile phone at the hotel so I couldn’t call for help. I didn’t know what to do. I tried banging on the window but there was nobody around. Gradually, I realized that I was going to have to spend the night in the bookstore. What a nightmare. Then I had a great idea. Fortunately, the Internet was still working so I logged on to Facebook and updated my status. I said something like “Help, I’ve been trapped in a bookstore for two hours and can’t get out.” One of my friends saw the message and telephoned the local police station. Eventually, after I had been in there for about three hours, the police arrived with a member of staff and I was freed. It wasn’t all bad though, at least I had a something to read while I was waiting.
