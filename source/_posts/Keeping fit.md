## Transcript
J = Jack, D = David, M= Maria

J: Hey Maria! Out walking again?

D: Hi! What’s with all the walking?

M: Hi guys! Well, phew, walking helps me stay in shape. Phew! It’s really good you know – it’s guaranteed to tone your leg muscles and burn off calories, and it’s great to be outdoors – I get claustrophobic in gyms.

J: Me too, though I do try to keep fit. Try is the word!

M: Yeah? What do you do Jack?

J: Well, I do some stuff at home. I lift weights, OK, and do push-ups, usually on alternating days. And I walk a lot, maybe 10 to 15 kilometres at a time.

D: No way – you really do all that? Why?

J: Well, I’m not getting any younger! It helps keep my weight down and keeps me active. The weights and push-ups build up muscles – see this David? – and walking really strengthens your heart and lungs.

D: Hmm. I watch football, if that counts.

M Huh! You know, there are some great activities around. I’ve tried zorbing and bungee jumping, and I did zip-lining last year, which was really good. I don’t suppose you’ve tried anything unusual, have you David?

D: Me? Unusual ways to keep fit? Like what? I don’t even know what they are! What’s zorbing?

M: Well, you’re inside a giant ball and you walk or roll around in it. It works wonders for developing your sense of balance.

D: Hhhmmm, I don’t think so, not for me. Are you into all this too, Jack?

J: No, not really. I mean, zip-lining? I’ve never heard of it.

M: Well, it’s where you climb up somewhere and then slide down a wire. Climbing’s really amazing for improving agility and there’s a real adrenalin rush as you go down – it’s incredibly effective for stamina and arm muscles too.

J: Oh, so that’s zip-lining! No, I’m not really into extreme sports – the most extreme sport I’ve done is tennis! No – extreme sports, not for me, thank you.

M: Oh well! I’m off, got another three kilometres to do. See you later.

D&J: See you.
