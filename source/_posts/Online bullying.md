## Transcript
**Mary**: OK, let's get this meeting started. Firstly, thank you all for taking the time to come here today to discuss this important issue. I know we are all concerned about bullying. I'd like to introduce you to Cindy Walsh from Stand Up to Bullying. Cindy is here to talk to us about online bullying, what we can do about it, and to show us some materials for schools. Welcome Cindy.

**Cindy**: Thanks Mary. Hello everyone and thanks for coming along today to discuss this very important issue.

**Mary**: Cindy could you perhaps start with a few words about the case I was telling you about the other day, our Year 7 student, Jenny? I guess the first question is whether or not this case is common.

**Cindy**: Sure, I can talk about that ... Unfortunately, stories like Jenny's are not unusual. Recent research has found that one in three children in the UK have reported similar issues. Everyone has access to the internet these days, and just like in real life, bullying happens online. Perhaps it's an even more serious issue for young people as they tend to spend so much time on the net.

**Dave**: So, if Jenny's story is not unusual, what can we do about this? I mean, most of this bullying seems to happen outside of school hours, so surely it's more the parents' responsibility than the school's?

**Cindy**: Well, yes, that is true but we at Stand Up to Bullying believe it's important that schools play a part in educating young children about how to keep themselves safe online. It's pretty common for children to use the internet for homework or research purposes, for example, so schools should really be as involved as much as possible.

**Mary**: Yes, I agree with that. We can't expect parents to do it all themselves. So, what should we teach the children Cindy?

**Cindy**: Well, firstly, we need to teach them how to know when they are being bullied. They need to understand what bullying is.

**Jim**: Yes, that seems like a good starting point. So what exactly is it?

**Cindy**: Well, online bullying is when a person uses technology to deliberately and repeatedly harass, humiliate, embarrass or intimidate another person.

**Jim**: So, you mean name calling, or saying nasty things about someone?

**Cindy**: Well yes, that would be humiliating and embarrassing someone. Making them feel bad about themselves because of their appearance, their abilities or their personality.

**Jim**: So, what do you mean by ‘harass'?

**Cindy**: Well, by ‘harass', I mean an unwanted behaviour that is repeated, sometimes over months and quite often by more than just one person.

**Mary**: And by ‘intimidate', I guess you mean making the person feel afraid of some physical harm or unpleasant experience happening?

**Cindy**: Yes, that's correct.

**Jim**: Um, what I don't understand is why the kids don't say anything, why they don't tell someone.

**Cindy**: Well, that's the thing about bullying. Often victims of bullying blame themselves and so do not tell others who may be able to support them. That is another important thing we need to teach children - not to think that it's their fault.

**Dave**: OK, I get what you are saying but I still feel like we have to look at why parents aren't controlling their children's use of social media.

**Cindy**: Yes, it is true that parents do have responsibility but the thing is that online bullying can happen in many different ways, by mobile phone, text messages, email, online games and increasingly through social media sites. It's almost impossible for parents to control all of these in today's world.

**Mary**: Yes, I agree with you Cindy. Am I right in saying that Stand Up to Bullying has organised online campaigns for both parents and young people?

**Cindy**: Yes, you're right Mary. We believe that this is an issue for the whole community. That's why we have campaigns to support and educate both parents and young people.

**Jim**: Well, it sounds like you are doing great work, Cindy.

**Cindy**: Yes, slowly but surely! This is a big issue. So, why don't we now have a look at and discuss the lessons we have designed for schools?

**Mary**: I think that's a great idea, Cindy. Let's all break into groups and look at the materials.
