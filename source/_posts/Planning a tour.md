## Transcript
Rachel: John, you’re the only one of us who’s been there before. What do you suggest we see first? How about the Eiffel Tower?

John: Well, I think we should give that a miss. It’s too touristy and even with a ticket, you have to queue for ages.

Ben: Hmm, I suppose you’re right. What would you recommend?

John: We could go on a river cruise and see Paris from the water. The bridges on the river are stun- ning and look magical when they’re lit up.

Rachel: Yes, that’d be great for the evening. What about something cultural in the day?

John: We could spend a whole day walking around the historical parts of the city and seeing the cathedrals and the amazing architecture.

Rachel: Whatever we do, I really want to see Monet’s Water Lilies. There are also some other museums I’d like to see.

Ben: Perhaps we could take one day to see the outdoor attractions like gardens, parks and cathe- drals and then do the river cruise in the evening and ...

Rachel: Yes, and then have a look round the museums and galleries on the second day. That sounds like a good idea.

John: That sounds like a good idea.

Rachel: And what about food? We’ve got to try some French cuisine!

Ben: We’ll have to be careful. My sister said there are some rather overrated restaurants.

John: It’s okay. I know some that are really worth going to. Reasonably priced too.
