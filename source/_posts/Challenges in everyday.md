## Transcript
Part 1
**Tenant**: Hi, Mr Thompson, how’s it going?

**Landlord**: Oh, David, hi! I was just looking for you!

**Tenant**: Oh really? What’s going on?

**Landlord**: I’m afraid we will have to increase your rent fee starting from next month.

**Tenant**: Are you serious?! Why?

**Landlord**: Well, you see we were contacted by the utility services and they are going to double the water tariffs.

**Tenant**: Great! That’s just great!

Part 2
**Landlord**: David, I know how you feel. That was my initial reaction as well. But I’m afraid there’s nothing we can do.

**Tenant**: So much for Europe this summer … Oh well. That’s the way it goes I guess ...

**Landlord**: What do you mean?

**Tenant**: Well, the thing is, I wanted to visit my parents in Europe, so I was trying to save some money … But I’m barely keeping up as it is. How can we make it work? Would it be possible for you to pay part of it?

**Landlord**: Well, we’re not going to ask you to pay all of it anyway …

**Tenant**: You’re not?! Oh, that’s a relief.

**Landlord**: No, we’re not. We’ll pay half, but you’ll have to pay the rest. I know the situation’s quite difficult right now.

**Tenant**: Yeah, thanks a million! ... However, in present conditions it still might be too much … I might have to find another job one way or another.

**Landlord**: I understand. Hmm … I remember you were in IT design, was it?

**Tenant**: Yeah, it’s IT developing, actually, but …

**Landlord**: Anyway, my grandson got promoted to the head of department at this big IT company downtown … T&G or something … whatever, and he’s looking for IT specialists. I could give you Brandon’s contacts if you’re interested.

**Tenant**: You must be joking! You’re kidding! Your grandson works for T&G?! You’ve never told me that!

**Landlord**: Well, maybe you should come for a chat every now and then, not just say ‘hello’ and pass by.

**Tenant**: I sure will! Oh, by the way! The lamp I told you about is flickering again.

**Landlord**: Is it? All right, I’ll have Robert take a look at it.
