## Transcript 
John: Hi, that was a fantastic performance, wasn’t it? They’re really talented musicians.

Clare: Yes, I really enjoy listening to this group. Do you often go to concerts?

John: I usually go a few times a year. I go to the cinema more often. Do you like watching films?

Clare: Yes, I especially enjoy dramas and comedies. But I hardly ever go to the cinema. I usually just watch films at home on DVD. What else do you like to do for fun?

John: I like playing sports. I often play tennis at the weekends. And in the winter, I like to go to the mountains to ski.

Clare: I like going to the mountains, too! I really enjoy the outdoors. When the weather is nice, I go hiking and camping at the weekends.

John: Perhaps we could go hiking together sometime. Here’s my card.

Clare: And here’s mine. I must get going now. Nice meeting you!
