## Transcript
Gwyn:   That reminds me. Have I ever told you about the time I burnt down a hospital? 

Rhonda: You did what?!! You burnt down a hospital?!!

Gwyn:   Well, I didn’t exactly burn it down, but they evacuated the patients and five fire engines arrived!

Rhonda: No! How awful! How did it happen?

Gwyn:   Well, I was making toast and ...

Rhonda: Making toast? What were you doing in the hospital? You weren’t a patient, were you?

Gwyn:   No, I was working there as a porter.

Rhonda: Oh, were you?

Gwyn:   Yes, it was a summer job years ago. Anyway, I was making toast and they told me to go and take lunch to the patients.

Rhonda: I see, but why did they tell you to do that if you were making toast?

Gwyn:   Well, you see, I wasn’t actually supposed to be making toast ... the toast was for me.

Rhonda: Ah, was it?

Gwyn:   Aha. All the porters and kitchen staff used to nick food all the time ... It’s hungry work you know.

Rhonda: Right, so you were making toast and went off to take some food to the ward. And then?

Gwyn:   Then, when I came back the toast was burning and there was smoke everywhere and, of course, the fire alarms were all going off.

Rhonda: Oh dear ...

Gwyn:   Indeed! And all the poor patients were being helped out of the hospital and there were five fire engines on the way.

Rhonda: That’s terrible. What happened in the end?

Gwyn:   Well, of course everyone was OK, but the hospital administration were furious.

Rhonda: I imagine.

Gwyn:   They said it had never happened before, but funnily enough the same thing happened three weeks later!

Rhonda: (trying not to laugh) Sorry, I shouldn’t laugh. .. It wasn’t you again, was it? 

Gwyn:   No.

Rhonda: That’s a relief.
