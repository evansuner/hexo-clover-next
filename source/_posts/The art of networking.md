Mr Johnson: I’m Tom, how do you do?

Ms Wallace:How do you do? I’m Clare.

Mr Johnson:So, who do you work for?

Ms Wallace: I work for the Royal Tea Company, I’m in charge of marketing for East Asia.

Mr Johnson: Well, we have something in common then. I work in the tea industry too. Ms Wallace: Oh really, what do you do?

Mr Johnson: I own Piccadilly, it’s a chain of British style cafés in Malaysia and Thailand.

Ms Wallace: I’m sorry, I haven’t heard of it.

Mr Johnson:That’s ok. The company was only founded two years ago.

Ms Wallace:How’s business?

Mr Johnson:Really good, thanks. We’re already looking to expand into Japan and Korea.

Ms Wallace:Well, my company supplies lots of hotels and cafés with tea. Here, I’ll give you my card.

Mr Johnson:Yes, perhaps we can do business in the future. Here’s my card.

Ms Wallace: Thanks Tom, it’s been a pleasure.
