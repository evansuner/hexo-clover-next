Woman: I'm trying to make a budget. How do you usually do it?

Man: Hmmm. I usually divide my income into three different spending categories: expenses, savings, and investments.

Woman: I see. I have some credit card debt. .. should i start investing some money?

Man: No, if you have anny debts, you should pay it off as fast as you can before you start investing. It's much more important to be debt-free.

What would you like to be?

Exampli:

I would like to be a person in the second picture who has a love job but doesn't pay much. If i won a very big amount of lottery, at the beginning i would be very excited and travel all over the world and buy lots of things what i can't afford before, but few years later i must feel hated with the days travelling all the time. Because a lot of money would make me lose my way and become empty. Compared with the second choice, enjoying the work i love every day makes me feel that i am real man, feel energetic and try my best to earn a better life style.
